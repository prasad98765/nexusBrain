## Best Practices for Admins

### Creating Quick Buttons

#### ✅ Do:
- Use clear, complete prompts
- Test button text before deploying
- Keep prompts specific and actionable
- Use buttons for common questions

#### ❌ Don't:
- Use vague or ambiguous text
- Create buttons with incomplete prompts
- Use buttons for complex queries
- Skip testing before deployment

### Example Good Button
```
Label: "Shipping Info"
Emoji: 📦
Text: "What are your shipping options and delivery times?"
✅ Clear, complete, ready to send
```

### Example Bad Button
```
Label: "Info"
Emoji: ℹ️
Text: "info about"
❌ Vague, incomplete, needs editing
```
