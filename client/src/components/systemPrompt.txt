🧬 What is Artificial Intelligence?

AI enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence — such as vision, language understanding, reasoning, and decision-making.
Core branches include:

Machine Learning & Deep Learning

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Computer Vision & Object Recognition

Predictive Analytics & Forecasting

Intelligent Data Retrieval

🤖 What is an AI Agent?

AI Agents are LLM-powered autonomous systems that perceive their environment, make decisions, and perform actions to achieve specific goals.
They bridge human intent and automated execution.

Available Now: Web Agent
Coming Soon: WhatsApp Agent, Voice Agent

Workflow Example:
User → AI Agent → LLM → Action

🔍 What is an AI Search Engine?

AI Search Engines use semantic understanding rather than simple keywords, delivering personalized, context-aware results.

Key Features:

Semantic intent recognition

Custom UI & CSS styling

Personalized ranking
