| Parameter     | What It Does                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `model`       | Choose a model that OpenRouter supports (e.g. `"openai/gpt-4o-mini"`, `"anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"`, etc.). If you use a wrong model name, you’ll get no answer. |
| `messages`    | Array of messages (`system`, `user`, `assistant`). At least one `user` role is required.                                                                           |
| `max_tokens`  | Max reply length. Too small → you get cut-off answers.                                                                                                             |
| `temperature` | Randomness. `0` = deterministic, `1` = more creative.                                                                                                              |
| `top_p`       | Alternative sampling control. Usually keep at `0.9`.                                                                                                               |
| `stream`      | If `true`, response comes **token by token** (you need a streaming handler). For testing, keep `false`.                                                            |
| `stop`        | Define custom stop sequences. If you set this wrong, you might get **empty output**. Better leave it `null`.                                                       |
| `logit_bias`  | Advanced. Pushes the model toward or away from certain tokens. Usually leave `{}`.                                                                                 |
| `user`        | An identifier for your end user (helps with tracking).                                                                                                             |
| `metadata`    | Custom key-value data for your app’s analytics.                                                                                                                    |
