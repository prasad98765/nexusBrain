Refactor the entire **Nexus AI Hub** web project to replace the current dark and basic theme with a modern, interactive design inspired by **yellow.ai**.

### üé® Design & Theme Requirements

1. **Overall Look:**

   * Switch from the dark theme to a **light, elegant, and high-contrast interface**.
   * Use **vibrant gradients** (yellow + purple or yellow + white) for accents.
   * Improve spacing, rounded elements, and soft shadows for a premium look.

2. **Color Palette:**

   * Primary: `#FFD600` (Yellow.ai yellow)
   * Secondary / Accent: `#5A31F4` (Purple)
   * Background: `#FAFAFA` (Light gray / white)
   * Text: `#1A1A1A`
   * Keep all text and icon colors optimized for readability on light backgrounds.

3. **Typography:**

   * Font: `Inter`, `Poppins`, or `Manrope` (Google Fonts)
   * Headings: bold and wide-spaced
   * Body: medium weight with more white space

4. **Components & Layout:**

   * Update all buttons to rounded corners (`border-radius: 12px`)
   * Add gradient hover effects (e.g., yellow-to-purple)
   * Apply consistent button sizing and padding
   * Replace icons with **lucide-react** or **Phosphor Icons**
   * Add smooth transition animations (hover, scroll, fade-in)

5. **Hero Section:**

   * Add a **looping AI-themed video or background animation** (e.g., gradient waves, particles, or neural patterns)
   * Keep the main heading and CTA (‚ÄúGet Started Free‚Äù, ‚ÄúExplore Features‚Äù) clear and centered
   * Use layered gradients instead of dark overlays

6. **Interactivity:**

   * Add **scroll-based animations** for elements (fade-in, slide-up, parallax)
   * Add hover scaling or glowing effects to cards and icons
   * Include subtle motion effects similar to yellow.ai‚Äôs landing page

7. **Apply Changes Across All Routes:**

   * `/features`
   * `/why-choose`
   * `/about`
   * `/get-started`
   * `/home`
   * Maintain consistent typography, spacing, and component styling

8. **Optional Enhancements:**

   * Add animated gradient background (CSS or canvas)
   * Update favicon and logo to match new color scheme
   * Include micro-interactions (button click ripples, floating CTA, etc.)

### ‚úÖ Goal

Deliver a **modern, bright, interactive** UI theme that looks and feels like **yellow.ai**, with consistent styling across all routes and components. Prioritize visual polish, smooth animation, and user engagement while keeping load performance optimized.
